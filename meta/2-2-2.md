  Percent of children under 5 years with weight-for-height/length <2 standard

  Estimates reported pertain to the 2-year pooled NHANES data. The estimates for
  percent wasting and overweight met the NCHS standards for reliability and
  precision and the confidence interval width for both estimates was less than 5
  percent.

  By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the
  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5
  years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant
  and lactating women and older persons.

  The NHANES data were merged with the expanded WHO growth chart files of
  weight-for-length/height for boys and girls by age. For the wasting estimate,
  the number of children 5 and younger with weight-for-length/height 2 or more
  standard deviations below the median weight-for-length/height was divided by
  the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was
  multiplied by 100. For the overweight estimate, the number of children with
  weight-for-length/height 2 or more standard deviations above the median
  weight-for-length/height was divided by the total number of children from
  birth through 5 years and the result was multiplied by 100. The numbers and
  resulting estimates are weighted to be nationally representative.
