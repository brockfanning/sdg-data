computation_definitions: Under-five mortality is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births.
computation_calculations: >-
  The probability of a child born in a specific year dying prior to the age of 5 years is calculated by first calculating the number of deaths of children below 5 years of age for a specific year and then dividing this value by the number of live births for the same year. Both the numbers
  of deaths of children below 5 years of age, in this case involving the addition of Infant deaths (under 1 year of age) and deaths amongst children aged 1-4, and live births for a specific year can be drawn from the yearly Childhood Mortality statistics, dating back to 2008.
