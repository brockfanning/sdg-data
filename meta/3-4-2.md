  'Suicide: In the United Kingdom, suicide is defined as deaths given an underlying cause of intentional self-harm or injury/poisoning of undetermined intent. To calculate suicide mortality rates, we took the total number of registered suicides deaths in a year and divided by the
  population and multiplied by 100,000.'

  Due to the nature of deaths attributed to suicide, the year of registration and the year of incidence can often differ; this may affect the calculation of suicide rates.   Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with
  topic experts.
